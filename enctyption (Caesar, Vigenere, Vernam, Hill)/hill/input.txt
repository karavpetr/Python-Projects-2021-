E, fifth letter of the alphabet, derived from a Semitic consonant that represented a sound similar to the English h, Greek Îµ, and Latin E. The original Semitic character may have derived from an earlier pictograph representing a lattice window or a fence. From the 4th century ce both the uncial and cursive forms were rounded. From these developed the Carolingian form, from which the modern minuscule e is derived.

History of the letter e. The letter may have started as a depiction of a man with arms upraised in Egyptian hieroglyphic writing and in very early Semitic writing. The sign meant joy or rejoice to the Egyptians. About 1000 bce, in Byblos and other Phoenician and Canaanite centers, the sign was given a linear form, the source of all later forms. The sign was called he in the Semitic languages and stood for the sound h in English. The Greeks reversed the sign for greater ease in writing from left to right. They rejected the Semitic value h and gave it the value of the vowel e. The Romans adopted this sign for the Latin capital E. From Latin this form came unchanged into English. Roman handwriting changed the letter to a more quickly written form. From this is derived the English handwritten and printed small e.
